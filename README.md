# Vcr.HttpRecorder

.NET HttpClient integration tests made easy.

HttpRecorder is an `HttpMessageHandler` that can record and replay HTTP interactions through the standard `HttpClient` . This allows the creation of HTTP integration tests that are fast, repeatable and reliable.

Interactions are recorded using the [HTTP Archive format standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.har), so that they are easily manipulated by your favorite tool of choice.

## Recommended Setup (ASP.NET Core Integration Testing)

If you're using WebApplicationFactory, this is the simplest and most powerful way to enable automatic recording and replaying across all HttpClients:

```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task MyApiTest()
{
    using var context = new HttpRecorderConcurrentContext((_, _) => new HttpRecorderConfiguration
    {
        Mode = HttpRecorderMode.Auto, // Automatically records or replays
    });

    var client = webAppFactory.WithWebHostBuilder(builder =>
    {
        builder.ConfigureTestServices(services =>
        {
            services.AddHttpRecorderConcurrentContextSupport(); // Injects the handler globally
        });
    }).CreateClient();

    var response = await client.GetAsync("/api/my-endpoint");

    Assert.Equal(HttpStatusCode.OK, response.StatusCode);
}
```

‚úÖ No need to manually configure HttpClient

‚úÖ All HttpClients use the recorder automatically

‚úÖ .har files are stored per test method

‚úÖ Supports parallel test execution

## Install via NuGet

```
Install-Package HttpRecorder
```

## Using the Delegating Handler Manually

If you want to apply HttpRecorder to a specific HttpClient only ‚Äî without affecting the global DI container ‚Äî you can use the delegating handler directly:

```csharp
var interactionPath = "fixtures/test.har";

var client = new HttpClient(new HttpRecorderDelegatingHandler(interactionPath)
{
    InnerHandler = new HttpClientHandler()
})
{
    BaseAddress = new Uri("https://reqres.in/")
};
```

This is useful if you need more granular control over which clients are recorded.

üìù Tip: You can use CallerMemberName + CallerFilePath to automatically name har files per test.

## Features

#### Modes

 - `Auto` (default): Replay if cassette exists, otherwise record

 - `Record`: Always record

 - `Replay`: Always replay (throws if file is missing)

 - `Passthrough`: Bypass recorder, make real requests

You can override the mode with the HTTP_RECORDER_MODE environment variable ‚Äî useful in CI.


#### Matching Behavior

When replaying, HttpRecorder uses a rule-based matcher to determine which recorded response to return for a given request.

By default, if you don‚Äôt configure a matcher, it behaves exactly as if you had written:


```csharp
matcher = RulesMatcher.MatchOnce
    .ByHttpMethod()
    .ByRequestUri(UriPartial.Path);
```
This means:

Requests are matched by HTTP method and the path part of the URI

Each recorded request is used once and in order

If your test sends two identical requests, both must have been recorded

If there are not enough matching requests in the .har file during replay, the test will fail.

## Custom Matchers

You can customize the matching logic to match multiple times or add more rules ‚Äî for example:

```csharp
matcher = RulesMatcher.MatchMultiple
    .ByHttpMethod()
    .ByRequestUri(UriPartial.Path)
    .ByHeader("Authorization");
```

```csharp
matcher = RulesMatcher.MatchOnce
    .ByHttpMethod()
    .ByRequestUri(UriPartial.Path)
    .ByContent(); // matches by binary content
```

You can also match by deserialized JSON:

```csharp
matcher = RulesMatcher.MatchOnce
    .ByHttpMethod()
    .ByJsonContent<MyRequestDto>();
```

> üìù If none of the built-in rules suit your needs, you can implement a custom IRequestMatcher.

#### Anonymization

Mask sensitive fields before saving:

```csharp
var anonymizer = RulesInteractionAnonymizer.Default
    .AnonymizeRequestHeader("Authorization");

```

#### External HAR Support
You can use .har files recorded with tools like:

 - Fiddler

 - Chrome DevTools

 - Postman

Just pass the file path into the handler.


#### Custom Storage
You can override how and where interactions are stored via `IInteractionRepository`.


## Compared to WireMock


WireMock is a powerful tool, but sometimes it's more than you need ‚Äî especially for simple, deterministic testing of external API calls.
